## Data storage and portable version
The default data of the program is saved under `%appdata%/cocogoat/config`. 
For portable use (such as putting in a USB flash drive, etc.), 
you can create a new cocogoat folder where the program exe file is located, 
and this folder will be used as the data directory when the program starts

## FAQs
 - Q: Why the overlays are not transparent?  
   A: If you're using Windows 7 , you need to enable Aero.
 - Q: Why the application needs to be run as administrator?  
   A: Genshin Impact itself runs as administrator, so we also need administrator rights to simulate click in it.
 - Q: Is it safe? Will it send my game data to any servers?  
   A: Yes. We will not send any sensitive data without permission, and even crash reporting can be disabled.
 - Q: Can I export data to formats of xxx, yyy zzz?   
   A: Maybe in the future. Why not open some pull requests?
